**Project:** Aegis Industrial Defense Platform
**Author:** Angel L. Pinzon
**Created:** February 7, 2026
**Development Environment:** Personal Hardware & Cloud Infrastructure

## IP Declaration

This software is a general-purpose industrial reliability platform developed independently of any employment obligations.

1.  **Simulation Logic:** The data generated by this platform is based on standard thermodynamic principles (Newton's Law of Cooling) and ISO 10816 vibration standards. It does not utilize proprietary production data.
2.  **Infrastructure:** All development was conducted on personal equipment using open-source technologies (Rust, Python, MQTT, Docker).
3.  **Independence:** No employer code, network resources, or specific configuration files were used in the creation of this software.

## Extended IP Declaration

This software was developed **independently** on personal equipment, outside of employment obligations, and without use of employer resources.

### Development Environment

- **Hardware:** Personal laptop (not employer-issued equipment)
- **Accounts:** Personal GitHub account (AngelP17)
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Personal Oracle Cloud, Cloudflare, and development accounts
- **Development Schedule:** Evenings and weekends only
- **Location:** Personal residence, not employer facilities

### Technical Foundation

This platform is a **general-purpose industrial monitoring system**, not specific to any employer's proprietary manufacturing processes or trade secrets.

The software architecture and algorithms are based on:

1. **Public Domain Engineering Principles:**
   - Heat transfer modeling: Newton's Law of Cooling (undergraduate thermodynamics)
   - Vibration analysis: ISO 10816 machinery vibration standards
   - Statistical process control: Shewhart control charts (Walter A. Shewhart, 1924)
   - Anomaly detection: Z-score analysis (standard statistical method)

2. **Open Source Software:**
   - MQTT Protocol: OASIS Standard, Eclipse Mosquitto implementation
   - TimescaleDB: PostgreSQL extension (Apache 2.0 license)
   - Rust Language: MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license
   - React Framework: MIT license

3. **Published Research:**
   - Bearing fault diagnosis: NREL/CWRU bearing dataset (public domain)
   - Predictive maintenance: IEEE PHM Society Data Challenge methodologies
   - Industrial IoT architectures: NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership guidelines

### What This Software Does NOT Contain

❌ Employer-specific manufacturing processes  
❌ Proprietary production formulas or recipes  
❌ Trade secrets or confidential business information  
❌ Customer lists or business relationships  
❌ Employer network configurations or IT infrastructure details  
❌ Any code written on employer time or equipment  

### Independence Verification

**Timestamp Evidence:**
- GitHub repository created: February 7, 2026 (public commit history)
- Development conducted: Personal residence (IP geolocation available if needed)
- No VPN connection to employer network during development
- No access to employer code repositories or internal systems

**Skill Verification:**
- Technical skills acquired through:
  - University of Arkansas B.S. Computer Engineering (2021-2025)
  - Public online courses (DataCamp, IBM, Oracle certifications)
  - Open source community contributions
  - Personal projects documented on apinzon.dev portfolio

### Generic vs. Specific Implementation

This software provides a **generic framework** that could be configured for any manufacturer using standard industrial protocols.

**Comparison:**

| Component | This Software (Generic) | Hypothetical Employer-Specific |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Equipment Interface** | Generic MQTT/Modbus adapter | Proprietary PLC ladder logic |
| **Failure Detection** | Statistical anomaly detection | Trade secret quality thresholds |
| **Physics Models** | Public domain heat equations | Confidential process parameters |
| **Configuration** | User-supplied YAML files | Employer's production schedules |

Any deployment at a specific manufacturer would require:
1. User-created configuration files (not part of this codebase)
2. Site-specific calibration data (provided by customer)
3. Integration with customer's existing systems (implementation services)

**Analogy:** This is like Microsoft Excel (generic tool) vs. an employer's financial model (specific implementation in Excel).
